<!-- Header content
Description
In this stage, your task is to build the header for the blog template. The header needs to contain the blog title, navigation menu, and right semantic tags for improved structure and accessibility. Use the <header> tag as the container and the <h1> tag for the blog title.

Create a navigation menu using <nav> and <ul> tags; each menu item should be displayed by an <li> that contains anchor links (<a>) to various sections of the blog.

Pay attention to the proper use of HTML semantics.

When you run the checks for the project, you will see that these checks apply CSS selectors to pinpoint the mistake. CSS selectors are patterns used to select HTML elements. They target specific elements based on their attributes, relationships, or position within the document structure, like so: header > h1. This targets <h1> elements specifically within the <header> element.

Objectives
In this stage, you are required to:

Use the <header> tag as the container for the header content.

Put any blog title within the suitable heading tag: <h1>.

Use the <nav> tag for the navigation section.

Use the <ul> tag to create an unordered list for the navigation menu items.

Create 5 separate list items within the list using <li> tags.

Each list item should contain an anchor tag <a> with appropriate href attributes for the different sections/pages of the blog. -->
